## Project Title
**CitiSense: A Smart City Data Integration and Visualization Platform**

The **Information Resource and Analysis Division (IRAD)** of the **Department of Science and Technology – Science and Technology Information Institute (DOST-STII)** currently faces a time-consuming process of manually analyzing thousands of survey responses. These responses often come in **English, Tagalog, or a mix of both**, making manual analysis more complex and prone to inconsistencies.  

Given the large volume of feedback data, IRAD aims to implement a system that can automatically process and analyze responses to extract **meaningful insights quickly and accurately**.  

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, a branch of machine learning, enables computers to interpret and understand human language. It is commonly used by organizations to analyze text data from emails, forms, and social media, identifying the sentiment or intent behind messages.  

This project leverages NLP to:
- Implement a system capable of **sentiment analysis** in both English and Tagalog.  
- Convert analyzed results into **visualized sentiment trends** through dashboards and reports.  

Through automation, the system aims to **reduce manual workload**, **streamline analysis**, and **enhance decision-making**, enabling DOST-STII to respond more efficiently to stakeholder feedback.

## Project Context
The project, titled **CitiSense**, is a **bilingual web application** developed by the **QuadThink team** in collaboration with the **Department of Science and Technology – Science and Technology Information Institute (DOST-STII)**, specifically its **Information Resource and Analysis Division (IRAD)**.  

As a division tasked with collecting and managing data that supports public science communication, IRAD plays a vital role in understanding public sentiment. However, the existing feedback processing method is **manual, limited by language barriers,** and **lacks real-time visualization tools**. This makes it challenging to scale analysis and deliver timely insights.  

**CitiSense** addresses these limitations by integrating a **fine-tuned NLP model** to automatically classify feedback as **positive, neutral,** or **negative** in both **English and Tagalog**. The processed data is then displayed through **interactive visual dashboards**, giving stakeholders real-time insights for faster, more data-driven decision-making.  

Aligned with **DOST-STII’s mission** to strengthen science and technology information systems, CitiSense supports their goal of improving public engagement through modern, automated tools. By integrating seamlessly with DOST’s existing feedback forms, the system ensures an **inclusive, efficient,** and **intelligent feedback analysis process** that empowers the government agency to act quickly and effectively based on public sentiment.
