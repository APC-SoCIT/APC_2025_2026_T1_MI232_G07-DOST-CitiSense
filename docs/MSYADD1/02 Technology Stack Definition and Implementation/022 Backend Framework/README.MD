Backend Framework:

The backend of the system was developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework that promotes clean, reusable, and maintainable code. It served as the core logic layer of the system, handling data processing, sentiment model integration, and secure communication with the frontend through RESTful APIs. Djangoâ€™s robust structure and built-in tools also enhanced the reliability, scalability, and performance of the overall application.
