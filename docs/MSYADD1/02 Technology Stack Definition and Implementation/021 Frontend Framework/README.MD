Frontend Framework: 

The frontend of the system was developed using React.js, a JavaScript framework designed for creating dynamic and responsive web interfaces. Through its component-based architecture, React enabled modular development and efficient rendering of content, allowing real-time interaction between users and the system. It also facilitated smooth integration with the backend by communicating through APIs to display sentiment analysis results accurately and interactively.
